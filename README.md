A project to create a web app that takes input from a user via a form. It then takes the information found via the form and stores the variable. Then the user is redirected to a page which will diplay the time until their birthday or wishing them congratulations if it is their birthday. 

Built using ruby and sinatra, while tested with Capybara.

After the user adds in thier information to the form a new class of Timepiece is created and all parameters are stored within it. This allows easy access and manipulation of all of the data.
